# 🎥 Full-Stack Video Calling Application

A full-stack, role-based video conferencing platform built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and powered by ZegoCloud. 

This application allows "Hosts" (consultants, doctors, admins) to schedule and manage video meetings, while allowing "Guests" (clients, patients) to securely join validated rooms via a shared Room ID.

## ✨ Features

* **Role-Based Authentication:** Secure JWT-based login and signup system separating users into "Host" and "Guest" roles.
* **Host Dashboard:** Hosts can create instant meetings or schedule future meetings. Scheduled meetings are saved to the database and displayed on their dashboard.
* **Guest Validation:** Guests can only join active, scheduled rooms. The backend validates the Room ID against the MongoDB database before granting access.
* **Live Video & Audio:** High-quality, real-time video conferencing powered by ZegoCloud UIKits.
* **Smart Room Management:** Easy "Copy Room ID" functionality. Rooms are automatically deleted from the database the moment the Host ends the call to keep the schedule clean.
* **Modern UI:** Responsive, gradient-styled user interface built with React.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
* React (Vite)
* React Router DOM (for navigation & protected routes)
* Context API (for state & auth management)
* ZegoCloud UIKit Prebuilt (for WebRTC video infrastructure)

**Backend:**
* Node.js & Express.js
* MongoDB & Mongoose (Database modeling)
* JSON Web Tokens (JWT) (Authentication)
* Bcrypt.js (Password hashing)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
* A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) account and cluster.
* A [ZegoCloud](https://www.zegocloud.com/) account (App ID and Server Secret).

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME

2. Backend Setup
Bash
cd backend
npm install
Create a .env file in the backend folder and add the following variables:

Code snippet
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_generated_random_secret
Start the backend server:

Bash
npm run dev
3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory:

Bash
cd frontend
npm install
Note: Make sure to securely provide your ZegoCloud credentials via environment variables before deploying.

Start the React development server:

Bash
npm run dev
💻 Usage
Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

Sign up as a Host: Create an account selecting the "Host" role. You can schedule meetings, start instant rooms, and copy Room IDs.

Sign up as a Guest: Open an incognito window and create a "Guest" account. You will only see the option to join a room.

Paste a valid Room ID generated by the Host to join the video call!

Before you run your `git push` command to send this up to GitHub, did you already move your ZegoCloud `appID` and `serverSecret` into a `.env` file, or are they still hardcoded in your `Video_Room.jsx` file? (If they are hardcoded, let's hide them first so bots don't scrape your keys!)
